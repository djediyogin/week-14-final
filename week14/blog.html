            <h2>My Journey in Web Development</h2>
            <p>
                Wow this class has been an immense challenge in many ways for me. I failed this class last semester due to pretty much throwing the towel in and giving up. but this time around that was absolutely not an option(it wasn't last semester but i did it anyways.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I ran into a massive barrier of learning curve for myself and had to call in reinforcements and support squadrons of elite level professionals in my network in order to complete the work of this class due to a number of reasons.
            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>No matter how much i read and reviewed and watched youtube videos attempting to explain and cover these subjects, i had difficulty grasping concepts such as debugging, syntax, and the vernacular associated with coding web design.</li>
                <li>I learned that this class is actually not utilizing programming, per normal industry standard usage of the term 'programming' but falls under web design.</li>
                <li>I learned how to begin using AI to generate code snippets, only to learn that the AI makes many mistakes, and that it is up to me to learn 'enough' about coding to correct the mistakes that AI made.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>
                I learned that there are different AI's other than ChatGPT that are superior for working in code. I learned from professionals in the industry side by side how to utilize AI correctly for coding, how to syntax, build and deliver a properly coded website in a way that makes sense to other developers and to the machine itself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The class curriculum surprised me once I learned that it is a bit outdated and potentially misleading for a complete beginner like myself. Over all i found it confusing to figure out Javascript, but the HTML and CSS makes more sense to me as an artist and designer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Speaking of, as an artist and designer, learning these languages and computer context has allowed me to have a better understanding of interfacing with developers, and according to the professors, it is relevant to some part of my degree of Digital Maker Fabricator, but i still am not sure what amount of usage i will implement this in my actual work. Overall the biggest challenge and takeaway was the ability to innovate and be agile in my approach to finishing the coursework without failing the class again. my methods have been unorthodox, stigmatized and possibly looked poorly upon by academia officials, yet from a professional standpoint, considering my role, I believe i executed the work necessary in a way that i would in real life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                My biggest takeaway here is that I've learned to adapt in unconventional unorthodox ways that can provide feedback for the school officials regarding the coursework, the delivery of the content, and the context on the technology that is being taught here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As far as the actual course content, i am now familiar with coding environments, and know a little bit about the context of how to approach coding in webspaces, perhaps there is a familiarity that can translate to different professional environments in my future, but not sure exactly if or how i will implement this knowledge in my own fields of design and professional business.

            <h2>The Power of Perseverance</h2>
            <p>
                This journey of learning web development has been a roller coaster ride, to say the least. There were times when I felt like I was on top of the world, and there were times when I felt like I was in a deep abyss. But one thing that kept me going was my perseverance.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I remember the first time I encountered a bug in my code. I spent hours, days even, trying to figure out what was wrong. I read and re-read the code, searched for solutions online, and even sought help from my peers. But no matter what I did, I couldn't fix the bug. It was frustrating, to say the least.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But instead of giving up, I decided to persevere. I took a step back, took a deep breath, and approached the problem with a fresh perspective. And guess what? I finally managed to fix the bug. It was a small victory, but it was a victory nonetheless.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This experience taught me the power of perseverance. It taught me that no matter how difficult a problem may seem, there's always a solution if you're willing to persevere. And this is a lesson that I will carry with me throughout my career in web development.

            <h2>Embracing the Unknown</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I faced during this course was the fear of the unknown. I was stepping into a new world, a world filled with codes and algorithms, a world that was completely alien to me. And that was scary. It was like being thrown into the deep end of a pool without knowing how to swim. The codes looked like cryptic messages, the algorithms seemed like complex puzzles, and the entire process felt overwhelming.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But as I delved deeper into the world of web development, I realized that the unknown wasn't something to be feared. It was something to be embraced. It was an opportunity to learn, to grow, and to expand my horizons. Each line of code I wrote, each algorithm I implemented, and each problem I solved was a step towards understanding this new world. It was a journey of discovery, filled with moments of frustration and moments of triumph.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I learned that it's okay to not know everything. In fact, it's impossible to know everything. The field of web development is vast and constantly evolving. There's always something new to learn, something new to explore. And that's what makes it exciting. It's a field that encourages curiosity and rewards creativity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also learned that it's okay to make mistakes. Mistakes are not failures, they are opportunities to learn. Each mistake I made was a lesson in what not to do. It was a chance to improve, to become better. And with each mistake I made, I became a better web developer.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And most importantly, I learned that it's okay to ask for help. No one is expected to figure out everything on their own. There are countless resources available, from online tutorials to community forums to peers and mentors. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. It shows that you are committed to learning and improving, that you are not afraid to admit when you don't know something.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So, to anyone who's embarking on a similar journey, I say this: Embrace the unknown. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Because that's where the magic happens. That's where you'll find growth, learning, and success. It won't be easy, there will be challenges and obstacles, but the rewards will be worth it. You'll gain new skills, new knowledge, and a new perspective. And who knows, you might even discover a passion you never knew you had.
